## 1. **Divide and Conquer vs. Decrease and Conquer**

- **Divide and Conquer**:  
  - **Approach**: Divide a problem into multiple subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the solutions.
  - **Examples**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, FFT.
  - **Key Characteristics**: Recursively break down into smaller subproblems, solve, and combine.

- **Decrease and Conquer**:  
  - **Approach**: Reduce the problem size by one at each step and solve progressively smaller problems.
  - **Examples**: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.
  - **Key Characteristics**: Typically reduces the size by one each time.

**Extra Tip**: The difference lies in the number of subproblems: divide and conquer splits into **two or more** subproblems, while decrease and conquer reduces the problem size by **one element** each time.

---

## 2. **Greedy Algorithm**

- **Definition**: A greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that these choices lead to a global optimum.

- **Examples**:  
  - **Huffman Coding**: Efficiently compress data by assigning variable-length codes to characters.
  - **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree in a graph.
  - **Activity Selection Problem**: Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

- **Applications**:  
  - **Data Compression**: Huffman Coding.
  - **Network Design**: Kruskal’s Algorithm for minimum spanning trees.
  - **Scheduling**: Activity Selection Problem.

**Extra Tip**: Greedy algorithms are **fast** and often used in real-time systems, but they don’t always guarantee an optimal solution for every problem.

---

## 3. **Divide and Conquer**

- **Definition**: Divide the problem into **smaller subproblems**, solve them recursively, and combine the solutions to get the final result.

- **Examples**:  
  - **Merge Sort**: Recursively splits an array and sorts each part, then merges them.
  - **Quick Sort**: Selects a pivot, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts.
  - **Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication**: A faster matrix multiplication algorithm.

- **Applications**:  
  - **Sorting Algorithms**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
  - **Signal Processing**: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
  - **Matrix Multiplication**: Strassen’s Algorithm.

**Extra Tip**: Divide and conquer works best for problems that can be **recursively divided** into independent subproblems.

## 4. **Greedy vs. Divide and Conquer**

| **Feature**                | **Greedy Algorithm**                        | **Divide and Conquer Algorithm**                    |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**                | Makes local optimal choices at each step   | Divides the problem, solves subproblems, and combines results |
| **Efficiency**              | Generally faster (O(n log n) or O(n))      | More complex (usually O(n log n) or worse)           |
| **Use Cases**               | Scheduling, Graphs, Data Compression       | Sorting, Signal Processing, Optimization            |
| **Optimality Guarantee**    | Not always optimal                         | Often optimal, especially for large problems        |

**Extra Tip**: Greedy algorithms are simpler and faster but may fail in some cases, while divide and conquer generally ensures an optimal solution but at a cost of **complexity**.

- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph by sorting the edges and selecting the smallest edges.
- **Activity Selection Problem**: Selects the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a set.

**Extra Tip**: Greedy algorithms excel in **optimization problems** where decisions at each stage can be made without revisiting previous decisions.

---

## 6. **Advanced Applications of Divide and Conquer Algorithms**

- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Efficient algorithm for computing the discrete Fourier transform of a signal.
- **Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication**: Reduces the number of multiplications for matrix multiplication, improving time complexity.

## 7. **Problem Solving with Greedy and Divide & Conquer**

### **Greedy Problems**:
- **Activity Selection Problem**: Sort by finish time and select the earliest finish time activity, then choose subsequent activities that don’t overlap.
- **Huffman Coding**: Create a priority queue to build the binary tree for data compression.

### **Divide & Conquer Problems**:
- **Merge Sort**: Divide the array into two halves, recursively sort each half, and merge the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Partition the array around a pivot and recursively sort each partition.

**Extra Tip**: Use greedy algorithms when **local decisions** lead to a global optimum, and use divide and conquer when problems can be divided into **independent subproblems**.

## 8. **Heap, Heap Operations, and Heap Sort**

### **Heap**:
- **Heap Property**:
  - **Max Heap**: Parent node’s value is greater than or equal to its children.
  - **Min Heap**: Parent node’s value is less than or equal to its children.

### **Heap Operations**:
1. **Insertion**: Insert a new element at the end and restore heap property by **heapify up**.
2. **Deletion**: Remove the root (max in max-heap or min in min-heap), replace with last element, and **heapify down**.
3. **Heapify**: Convert an array into a heap.
4. **Peek**: View the root element without removing it.

**Extra Tip**: A heap is a **complete binary tree**, meaning it’s always fully filled except possibly at the last level.

---

### **Heap Sort**:
Heap Sort uses a heap data structure to sort elements.

1. **Build a max heap** from the input array.
2. **Swap** the root (max element) with the last element.
3. **Heapify down** the root element.
4. Repeat the process for the remaining elements.

**Time Complexity**:  
- **Building the heap**: O(n)  
- **Sorting**: O(n log n)  
- **Overall**: O(n log n)

**Space Complexity**:  
- O(1) (in-place sorting)

**Extra Tip**: Heap Sort is not **stable** (doesn’t preserve the order of equal elements) but is an efficient, in-place algorithm with guaranteed **O(n log n)** time complexity.

---

### **Applications of Heap**:
- **Priority Queue**: Elements are retrieved based on priority.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Used in Dijkstra’s and Prim’s algorithm for shortest paths and minimum spanning tree.
- **Kth Largest Element**: Finding the kth largest element in an unsorted array.

**Extra Tip**: Heaps are **ideal** for problems where the **largest** or **smallest** elements need to be accessed frequently.

---

### **Comparison of Heap Sort with Other Sorting Algorithms**:

| **Algorithm**        | **Time Complexity**  | **Space Complexity**   | **Stable**  |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Heap Sort**        | O(n log n)           | O(1)                   | No          |
| **Merge Sort**       | O(n log n)           | O(n)                   | Yes         |
| **Quick Sort**       | O(n log n) (average) | O(log n) (recursive)   | No          |
| **Insertion Sort**   | O(n^2)               | O(1)                   | Yes         |

## 9. **Kruskal's Algorithm**

- **Definition**: Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a graph.
- **Approach**:
  1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weights.
  2. Add edges one by one to the MST, making sure no cycle is formed.
  3. Use **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** or **Union-Find** to check for cycles.

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Sorting the edges: O(E log E), where E is the number of edges.
  - Union-Find operations: O(E α(V)), where V is the number of vertices.

**Extra Tip**: Kruskal's algorithm works well for **sparse graphs**.

---

## 10. **Prim's Algorithm**

- **Definition**: Prim's algorithm is also used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, but unlike Kruskal's, it grows the MST one vertex at a time.

- **Approach**:
  1. Start from an arbitrary vertex.
  2. Add the minimum-weight edge from the tree to the MST.
  3. Repeat until all vertices are included.

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Using a simple array: O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices.
  - Using a priority queue (binary heap): O(E log V), where E is the number of edges.

**Extra Tip**: Prim's algorithm works well for **dense graphs**.

---

## 11. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

- **Definition**: Dijkstra’s algorithm is used for finding the **shortest path** from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with **non-negative weights**.

- **Approach**:
  1. Initialize distances from the source to all vertices as infinity, except the source vertex.
  2. Set the source vertex’s distance to 0.
  3. Repeatedly select the vertex with the smallest tentative distance and update its neighbors.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Using a simple array: O(V^2).
  - Using a priority queue (binary heap): O(E log V).

**Extra Tip**: Dijkstra’s algorithm works best on graphs with **non-negative weights**.
