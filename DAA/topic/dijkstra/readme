### Dijkstra Algorithm with Priority Queue in Java

#### Project Description
This Java program implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted, directed graph. The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently select the next vertex with the smallest tentative distance. The graph is represented using an adjacency list, and the algorithm calculates the minimum distances from the source to all other vertices.


```java (to specify language)

    static class Edge {
        int target, weight;

        Edge(int target, int weight) {
            this.target = target;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

        }

        public int compareTo(Node other) {
            return this.distance - other.distance;
        }
    }

#### Diagram Explanation of the Code

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The `Graph` class represents the graph with a number of vertices (`vertices`) and an adjacency list (`adjList`). The adjacency list stores all the edges connected to a vertex. Each edge consists of a target vertex and a weight.

2. **Edge Class**:
   - The `Edge` class represents an edge in the graph, storing the target vertex and the weight of the edge.

3. **Node Class**:
   - The `Node` class is used to represent each vertex during the Dijkstra algorithm. It contains the vertex index and the current distance from the source vertex. The `compareTo` method allows the nodes to be sorted based on their distance, which is necessary for the priority queue to work.

4. **Dijkstra Algorithm**:
   - The `dijkstra` method implements the algorithm:
     - Initialize the distance array (`dist`) with `INF` (infinity), except for the source vertex, which is initialized to 0.
     - Use a priority queue to store vertices along with their distances. The priority queue ensures that we always process the vertex with the smallest distance.
     - For each vertex, iterate over its neighbors, and update their distances if a shorter path is found.
     - Finally, the results (shortest distances) are printed using the `printSolution` method.

5. **Input and Execution**:
   - The `main` method creates a graph with 5 vertices and adds edges with specified weights. The Dijkstra algorithm is then called with the source vertex `0`.

6. **Output**:
   - The algorithm prints the shortest distance from the source vertex to all other vertices. If a vertex is unreachable, it prints "INF".

### How to Explain This Code to Your Teacher:

1. **Start with the Problem**: 
   - "This program implements Dijkstra’s algorithm, which finds the shortest path in a graph from a source node to all other nodes. It’s commonly used in routing and network algorithms."

2. **Explain the Graph Representation**:
   - "I use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each vertex has a list of edges, and each edge stores the target vertex and the weight. The graph is directed, meaning the edges have a direction."

3. **Explain the Node and Edge Classes**:
   - "The `Edge` class stores the target vertex and weight of an edge. The `Node` class stores a vertex and its current distance from the source. I use the `compareTo` method in `Node` so the priority queue can order nodes based on distance."

4. **Walk Through the Dijkstra Algorithm**:
   - "The algorithm starts by initializing all distances to infinity, except for the source vertex, which is 0. I then use a priority queue to process the nodes in order of their distance, updating their distances as I find shorter paths."

5. **Explain Priority Queue**:
   - "The priority queue is essential for efficiently selecting the node with the smallest distance at each step. It’s based on a min-heap, so the node with the smallest distance is always at the top of the queue."

6. **Edge Relaxation**:
   - "For each node, I check all its neighbors and try to relax the edge. Relaxation means checking if the current known distance to a node can be improved by going through another node. If it can, I update the distance."

7. **Final Output**:
   - "Once the algorithm finishes, I print the shortest distance to each vertex. If a vertex is not reachable, I print `INF`."

### Possible Questions and Answers from Teacher:

1. **Q: What is the time complexity of this algorithm?**
   - **A**: "The time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm using a priority queue is O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because each vertex and edge is processed once, and each operation on the priority queue takes O(log V) time."

2. **Q: Why are you using a priority queue in this implementation?**
   - **A**: "The priority queue helps efficiently select the next vertex with the smallest tentative distance. Without it, we would have to scan through all vertices to find the one with the smallest distance, which would be slower."

3. **Q: What does the `compareTo` method in the `Node` class do?**
   - **A**: "The `compareTo` method allows nodes to be ordered in the priority queue based on their distance values. The priority queue uses this method to ensure that the node with the smallest distance is processed first."

4. **Q: Why do you initialize the distance array with `INF`?**
   - **A**: "We initialize all distances to infinity because, initially, we don't know the shortest path to any vertex. As the algorithm progresses, we update the distances with the actual shortest paths."

5. **Q: What happens if the graph contains negative weight edges?**
   - **A**: "Dijkstra’s algorithm doesn’t handle negative weight edges properly. If the graph contains negative weights, it may give incorrect results. For graphs with negative weights, we should use the Bellman-Ford algorithm instead."

6. **Q: Can this algorithm handle disconnected graphs?**
   - **A**: "Yes, the algorithm can handle disconnected graphs. If a vertex is not reachable from the source, the distance will remain `INF`, which indicates that there is no path."

7. **Q: How would the program behave if there is no edge in the graph?**
   - **A**: "If there are no edges in the graph, the algorithm will output `INF` for all vertices except the source, because there are no paths to any other vertex."
